The MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad User Experience project comes in three versions supporting three different IDEs: CCS, IAR, and msp430-gcc.
The CCS & IAR versions share the same code file, main.c, and have their associated project configuration files in the respective folders, CCS & IAR.
The version using the open-source compiler msp430-gcc is located inside the msp430-gcc folder. It contains three files:
1. launchpad.c: main code file
2. makefile: customized makefile for the project
3. readme.txt: some basic info on building the msp430-gcc project.
