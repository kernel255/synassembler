 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430F20x2 Demo - ADC10, DTC Sample A1-0 16x, AVcc, Repeat Seq, DCO
//
//  Description: Use DTC to sample A1/A0 repeat sequence 16x(32 total samples)
//  with reference to AVcc.  Software sets ADC10SC to trigger sample burst.
//  In Mainloop MSP430 waits in LPM0 to save power until ADC10 conversion
//  complete, ADC10_ISR will force exit from any LPMx in Mainloop on reti.
//  ADC10 internal oscillator times sample period (16x) and conversion (13x).
//  DTC transfers conversion code to RAM 200h - 240h.  ADC10(DTC) interrupt
//  will return system active. P1.0 set at start of conversion burst, reset
//  on completion.
//
