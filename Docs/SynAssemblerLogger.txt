Changing AudioEngine in order to support string type, need to use the wchar_t type, several modifications required.

Save of PCM Waveform OK

ComboBox still with problems: Fixed, now values are read

Found 2 problems:



1. Load of PCMWaveform causes crash: OK
2. Connection of MIDI does not work

reading of old files has crash here:

delegateHolder.writeEUDProp(m_EUId, OscillatorPanel.AMP_LFO_LEVEL_INDEX, d); => Read a bad file but there is no protection!
