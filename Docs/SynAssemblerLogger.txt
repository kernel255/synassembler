Changing AudioEngine in order to support string type, need to use the wchar_t type, several modifications required.

For C# to C++ just copy what done in initEngine(...)

Save of PCM Waveform OK

ComboBox still with problems: Fixed, now values are read

Found 2 problems:



1. Load of PCMWaveform causes crash: OK
2. Connection of MIDI does not work

reading of old files has crash here:

delegateHolder.writeEUDProp(m_EUId, OscillatorPanel.AMP_LFO_LEVEL_INDEX, d); => Read a bad file but there is no protection! Maybe the "bad" value has been placed by the uninitialized AudioEngine

Add extension to files: .sya OK

Problems found while loading oscillator:

1. Position of the needle is wrong once loaded, seems the problem is due to rotation operation after setting of read values
(When the read value is not set, the needle looks OK) The root cause is not the ActualSize=0 in Potentiomenter Fixed problem with Loading method, where the value is != 0, NEED TO RE-CHECK TO REMOVE DEBRIS...not OK! Still problems in loading...The problems are present ONLY when there are some breakpoints
2. Allocation of blocks is not done on load: Need to save position with integers OK
3. Values of sliders not saved...Problem present both in PCMWaveform and Oscillator
4. Problems on detection of modified Synthesizer
